I am an lecturer at the School of Physics, [China University of Petroleum (Beijing)](https://www.cup.edu.cn/english/). I earned my Ph.D. degree in Petroleum Engineering from [the University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/), advised by Professor [Christoph Arns](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/christoph-arns) and Dr. [Igor Shikhov](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/igor-shikhov). I obtained my Bachelor degree from [China University of Petroleum (East China)](https://english.upc.edu.cn). My research interests include practical Bayesian methods for inverse problems arising from (Bayesian) parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification in NMR petrophysics, core
analysis, groundwater management, etc (see [publications page](/publications/)). My current research is centered on estimating key physical parameters under various physical constraints using multi-objective Bayesian optimization.
