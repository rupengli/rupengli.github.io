description: Publications by categories in reversed chronological order.  My research focuses on estimating key physical quantities that are difficult to measure or simply non-measureble by solving inverse problems arising from core analysis using Bayesian optimization. I am particularly interested in extension to costly simulations with high-dimentional search spaces, functional output using multi-output GP or higher-order GP.
