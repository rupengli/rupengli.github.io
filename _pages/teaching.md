## As a lecturer

I have been involved in the following courses

#### Undergraduate Physics (II), Fall 2023 & Fall 2024

This is an compulsory course for students from all  engineering, science related disciplines, etc., a class typically involves **~120** students. Three modules are covered in this course:
- Oscillation and simple harmonic motion
- Physical optics
- Thermodynamics

Course evaluation: ranking **127 out of a total of 1012** courses university-wide **(top 12.5%)**
Provided 1-on-30 tutoring to students who were initially struggling, scoring below 30 on their
mid-term assessments. After several tutoring sessions, they achieved on average a score of 75 on
the final exam, with the highest achieved score of 92 **(ranking 8/124)**


#### Physics Experiments (I) & (II), Fall 2023 & Spring 2024

Physics is an experimental science. There are 10 experiments in accordance with the content of Undergraduate Physics (I) & (II) that are taught routinely, e.g.,
- Principle and application of oscilloscope
- Determination of wavelength of light using Newton's rings
- Measuring speed of sound in three phases of matter
- Measuring wavelength of light using Newtonâ€™s rings or a grating

## As a teaching assistant

#### Undergraduate Physics (II), Fall 2022

#### Physics Experiments (II), Fall 2022

#### Reservoir Characterization, Spring 2018-2020

The course introduces the student to the background knowledge in reservoir characterization and modeling and guide the student in integrating spatially sparse data across properties, and scales by application of geostatistical techniques.
- Simple and ordinary Kriging interpolation
- Stochastic simulation
- Univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistics for geological data analysis
- Up-scaling and their applications in geological modeling
