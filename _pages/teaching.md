## As a lecturer

I have been involved in the following courses

#### Undergraduate Physics (II), Fall 2023

This is an introductory level course in physics for students from all disciplines, typically involving ~150 students. Three modules are covered:

- Oscillation and simple harmonic motion
- Physical optics
- Thermodynamics

#### Physics Experiments (II), Fall 2023

Physics is an experimental science. There are 6 experiments in accordance with the content of Undergraduate Physics (II) that are taught routinely:

- Principle and application of oscilloscope
- Viscosity measurement
- Determination of wavelength of light using Newton's rings
- Applications of Polarized Light Microscopy
- Measuring speed of sound in three phases of matter
- Measuring Young's Modulus with Metal Flatstock

## As a teaching assistant

#### Undergraduate Physics (II), Fall 2022

#### Physics Experiments (II), Fall 2022

#### Reservoir Characterization, Spring 2018-2020

The course introduces the student to the background knowledge in reservoir characterization and modeling and guide the student in integrating spatially sparse data across properties, and scales by application of geostatistical techniques.

- Simple and ordinary Kriging interpolation
- Stochastic simulation
- Univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistics for geological data analysis
- Up-scaling and their applications in geological modeling
